# AWS Config

### AWS Config Rules Deployment
  There are multiple ways to deploy config rules available [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html) based on different use-cases. Deploying individual rules one by one is quite a time consuming task especially when you have hundreds of accounts in your AWS environment. Following methods are mostly used:
  
  1. To deploy rules across all accounts in an organization, AWS **Firewall Manager** can be used.
  1. To deploy multiple rules at a single time in one account, AWS Config **Comformance Packs** can be used for better hierarchy/grouping.
  1. Custom **CloudFormation** templates can be built having multiple config rules.
  
   **NOTE:** Rules can be managed or custom. But for custom rules, there may be some extra properties to be configured.
   
 ### Deploy Managed Config Rules
   - Individual Rules can be easily deployed in form of CloudFormation stacks using the following official s3 template URL for managed rules.
     
   		>s3.amazonaws.com/aws-configservice-us-east-1/cloudformation-templates-for-managed-rules/**[ THE_RULE_IDENTIFIER ]**.template
     
       Find Identifier for each managed rule [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html).
     
   - To deploy multiple managed config rules, a sample CloudFormation template file is given in directory above named **Deploy-Multiple-Managed-Rules.template**. This template has merged template resources for following managed config rules.
     	1. IAM_ROOT_ACCESS_KEY_CHECK
     	2. S3_BUCKET_VERSIONING_ENABLED
     	3. SUBNET_AUTO_ASSIGN_PUBLIC_IP_DISABLED
     	4. S3_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION_KMS
     	5. EC2_EBS_ENCRYPTION_BY_DEFAULT
  
  		**Note**: Above mentioned s3 endpoint is used to get CloudFormation template of individual managed rules to save time. If you want your own set of rules in template then merge them all avoinding any resource name/label/id conflict in template.
        
  - **Deploy-Multiple-Managed-Rules.template** can also be used as **TemplateBody** for a Config Conformance Pack. Sample Conformance Pack is given in **SampleConformancePack.yaml** file present in directory.
